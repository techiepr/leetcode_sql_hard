Difference Between ROWS BETWEEN and RANGE BETWEEN
Both are used in window functions to define the frame for calculations. The key difference is:

ROWS BETWEEN → Works with physical row positions.
RANGE BETWEEN → Works with values in the column (logical range).

Why RANGE BETWEEN Works Best
We Are Summing Over a Time Period (Months, Not Rows)

Since months are numeric values, RANGE BETWEEN correctly includes all salaries within the last 2 months.
If an employee did not work in a month, ROWS BETWEEN would only consider existing rows, potentially skipping months.
ROWS BETWEEN Works on Physical Row Positions

If an employee has gaps in months (e.g., worked in Jan, skipped Feb, worked in Mar), ROWS BETWEEN would skip missing months instead of summing correctly over a continuous 3-month period.
